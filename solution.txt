I divided the app into separate components. This way, it's easier to handle and change things later on.

The application is structured into four main components:

App Component
    - Root component.
    - Utilizes React's useState hook to maintain the pizza size, selected toppings, and the total cost.
    - Handles the logic of cost calculation based on user selections.

SizeSelector Component
    - Allows users to select the pizza size.
    - Renders radio buttons dynamically based on size options. Communicates user selection back to the App component.

ToppingsSelector Component
    - Enables users to choose toppings.
    - Provides a list of checkboxes for toppings. Maintains a local state for selected toppings and updates the App component accordingly.

SummaryBox Component:
    - Displays a summary of the user's selections and the total cost.
    - Receives selected size, toppings, and cost as props and displays them.


run:
    - npm i
    - npm run dev
